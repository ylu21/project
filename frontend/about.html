								<h3>Behind the Scenes:</h3>
								<p>The primary motivation for Dandelion Study (that's the full name!) is how crowded the prime studying locations here at the University of Rochester can get, especially around finals week. We figured we all have better things to do than to waste our time manually checking locations for space. Does Gleason have space right now? How packed is each level of the Stacks? There's never been a solution to these questions, until Dandelion Study.</p>

								<h2>How it Works:</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Dandy Study relies on students themselves takin the time to tell our system when they are studying in a spot. We thought about other ways of collecting this information, but any form of automated collection (such as motion detection or infared) intrudes on student privacy as well as being cost prohibitive. Using this system, all we need is a QR code per "spot", making it private, cheap, and maintainable. At each spot, you simply scan the QR code with <i>any</i> QR code reader app, and click on the link.</p>
								<p>This transmits data to our server that someone is using that spot, and when you view the map of that location, you can see your spot marked as taken. If everyone takes a few seconds of their time to use this system, then any student can look at the maps and decide where to study based on current, real time information about avaliable space. Once you're done, just scan the code again. And happy studying.</p>
